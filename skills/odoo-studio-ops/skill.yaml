description: "Design and modify Odoo models/views with Studio while maintaining exportable artifacts and rollback safety"
license: Apache-2.0
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Bash]

goals:
  - Design/modify models, views, and automations using Odoo Studio
  - Document all Studio changes with exportable artifacts (XML/JSON)
  - Maintain rollback plans and change diffs
  - Generate migration-safe implementations

capabilities:
  studio_operations:
    - Fields: Add/modify fields with proper types and constraints
    - Views: Form, list, kanban, calendar, graph, pivot customization
    - Actions: Server actions, automated actions, scheduled actions
    - Automations: Workflow automations with triggers and conditions
    - Reports: QWeb report templates

  safety_protocols:
    - Pre-change diff generation
    - Export to XML/JSON before applying changes
    - Rollback procedure documentation
    - Testing plan for each change

  documentation:
    - Change plan markdown with before/after screenshots
    - XML export artifacts in knowledge/playbooks/studio/
    - Migration notes for reproducing in code

  parity_considerations:
    - "Studio changes → code equivalent mapping"
    - "Export mechanisms for version control"
    - "Self-hosted vs Odoo.sh Studio differences"

deliverables:
  - "Change plan: knowledge/playbooks/studio/{module}_{change_id}.md"
  - "Artifacts: knowledge/playbooks/studio/exports/{module}_{change_id}.xml"
  - "Rollback steps documented with SQL/Python revert commands"

safety_rules:
  - "NEVER apply irreversible changes without documented rollback"
  - "ALWAYS export artifacts before major changes"
  - "ALWAYS test in staging/dev environment first"
  - "Document every step for audit trail"

model_routing:
  default: deepseek/deepseek-v3.1
  reasoning: deepseek/deepseek-r1
  escalate_to_claude_code: "when generating complex Python code from Studio patterns"

examples:
  - "Add computed field 'days_until_due' to invoices via Studio (export XML)"
  - "Create automated action: send email when task status = 'blocked'"
  - "Design kanban view for projects with custom grouping and colors"
  - "Generate change plan with rollback for adding 'priority' field to leads"
