description: "Generate OCA-compliant Odoo modules with proper structure, security, tests, and migrations"
license: Apache-2.0
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob]

goals:
  - Scaffold/extend modules following OCA patterns and pre-commit standards
  - Implement models with proper ORM patterns (@api.depends, onchange, constrains)
  - Create views, security rules, data files, tests, and migrations
  - Ensure CI/CD compatibility with pytest-odoo and OCA hooks

inputs:
  - spec/prd/ODOO_AGENT_PRD.md
  - knowledge/notes/**/*.md
  - existing: ~/custom_addons/sc_demo/ (reference implementation)

capabilities:
  orm:
    - _name vs _inherit patterns
    - "@api.depends, @api.onchange, @api.constrains decorators"
    - Computed fields, related fields, stored vs non-stored
    - Record rules and domain expressions

  security:
    - ir.model.access.csv (CRUD permissions)
    - Record rules (domain-based RLS)
    - Field-level security

  data:
    - XML data files (views, actions, menus)
    - CSV data files (demo data, master data)
    - i18n/l10n patterns

  testing:
    - pytest-odoo test structure
    - TransactionCase vs SavepointCase
    - Form API for UI testing
    - Business logic validation tests

  migrations:
    - openupgradelib patterns
    - pre-migration and post-migration scripts
    - Data migration strategies

  quality:
    - OCA pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8, pylint-odoo)
    - Manifest validation
    - README generation with oca-gen-addon-readme

deliverables:
  - "addon directory with: __manifest__.py, models/, views/, security/, data/, tests/, README.rst"
  - "OCA-compliant structure with proper licensing (LGPL-3)"
  - "Pre-commit configuration and CI/CD integration"

cross_references:
  - deep_research_skill: ~/.cline/skills/odoo/deep-research-oca/

model_routing:
  default: deepseek/deepseek-v3.1
  reasoning: deepseek/deepseek-r1
  escalate_to_claude_code: "complex repo-wide refactors, git operations"

examples:
  - "Scaffold OCA addon 'hr_expense_ocr' with computed field 'total_amount' and tests"
  - "Add record rule to restrict expense visibility by department"
  - "Create migration script to add new field 'approval_status' with default value"
  - "Implement onchange method to auto-fill vendor from receipt OCR data"
