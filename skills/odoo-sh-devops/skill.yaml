license: Apache-2.0
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Bash, WebFetch]

goals:
  - Manage Odoo.sh branch/build pipeline, staging, logs, backups
  - Provide self-hosted Docker parity for all Odoo.sh operations
  - Create runbooks for common operational tasks
  - Implement monitoring and alerting strategies

capabilities:
  odoo_sh:
    - Branch management: development, staging, production
    - Build pipeline: git push → build → deploy workflow
    - Logs: Application logs, database logs, web server logs
    - Backups: Automated backups, manual snapshots, restore procedures
    - Upgrading: Odoo version upgrades, module updates
    - Monitoring: Performance metrics, error tracking, uptime

  self_hosted_parity:
    - Docker Compose equivalent workflows
    - Backup strategies with pg_dump and volume snapshots
    - Log aggregation with syslog or ELK stack
    - Blue-green deployment patterns
    - Health checks and auto-restart

  deployment_strategies:
    - Feature branch workflow
    - Staging validation gates
    - Production deployment checklists
    - Rollback procedures

  operational_excellence:
    - SLA targets and monitoring
    - Incident response playbooks
    - Capacity planning
    - Cost optimization

  - "Runbooks: knowledge/playbooks/odoo-sh/{operation}.md"
  - "Parity guides: knowledge/playbooks/self-hosted/{operation}_equivalent.md"
  - "Monitoring dashboards and alert configurations"
  - "Deployment checklists with validation gates"

  escalate_to_claude_code: "complex deployment automation, infrastructure as code"

examples:
  - "Create Odoo.sh → staging deployment runbook with validation gates"
  - "Generate self-hosted Docker equivalent for Odoo.sh automated backups"
  - "Design blue-green deployment strategy with health check validation"
  - "Create incident response playbook for database connection issues"
  - "Document Odoo version upgrade procedure (16.0 → 17.0) with rollback plan"
